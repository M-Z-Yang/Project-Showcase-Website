                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    I have participated in numerous events as commitee and lead some. I've also lead a student club called LearnX+.<br>
                    Some projects I want to highlight are:<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>LearnX+ coordinator</li>
                        <li>PhysiConnect Director</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h2>LearnX Coordinator</h2>
                <p>
                    LearnX, or more specifically LearnX+ or LearnX student chapter, is a
                    student organisation led by lecturers to give physics students the opportunity
                    to upskill. As for the projects we have were QHack team building and Physics Plant
                    Analytics Lab(PhyPAL). Other than this, I also led initiatives like various workshops
                    and study sessions to further build and nurture the physics students of UM.

                <h2>PhysiConnect Director</h2>
                <p>
                    PhysiConnect is your average bonding event. The event included some fun activities
                    including an Explorace and a fun quiz session. As director, I was responsible for stringing 
                    everything together, making sure all departments were communicating and working properly. This
                    being my first UM event, I learned a lot about the event making process which propelled me
                    in my future endeavors.
